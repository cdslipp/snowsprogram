    role: "Co-Creator/Performer",
    bio: `Hungarian-born mezzo B칩 (Margaret) B치rdos is based in Southern Ontario and loves touring. At home with classical as well as new, experimental music, she seeks out creative challenges and cherishes working with good hearted people. With a voice described by Opera Canada as "mellow, fruity, that caresses the ears", Canadian and European appearances include interdisciplinary collaborative and site-specific projects that make use of her varied training: from Butoh dance and physical theatre to extended vocal technique and improvisation. She is a grateful member of the studio of Tom Schilling, sits on the board for NUMUS and InterArts Matrix, and continues as Company Manager at MT Space in Kitchener. When not on stage, in the studio, or working with arts organizations, she can be found on the back of a horse, or meditating under her favourite clump of trees.`
